IN MY STOCK

Is a practical and useful application that allows you to always know the status of your stock you are a professional, amateur or DIY enthusiast hobby.

This idea came to me as an amateur seamstress, I have many fabric scraps of any kind and a large stock of drapery, so I always forgot what my reserve included. As a result I lost a lot of time digging through my stock in search of the perfect product and when I made a purchase in the store I often bought what I already had. So I regretted not finding a simple, convenient and inexpensive way allowing me to control my stock and to consult it wherever I go. With this observation is born this application.

Now with IN MY STOCK you can create your own inventory by classifying and organizing your products according to your desire not category and sub-category, you can customize your application, quantify and illustrate your product sheets to identify at a glance.

So with My Stock you will know all the time, what you have in stock, whether you are at a supplier to a customer, or in your workshop. You can know all the details of your supplies: the size, color, material, reference, brand etc ...

To familiarize yourself with the tools and make the most of its capabilities, I invite you to consult Help and Tutorial.
